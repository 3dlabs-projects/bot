It is also used to create blueprints for buildings, bridges, and \ncomputer chips, among other things. Discover how AutoCAD is used by drafters and other \nprofessionals like CAD Drafting and Design Technology. \n \nCADWorx is an AutoCAD-based system, CADWorx is the next generation software \nsolution, providing intelligent drawing/database connectivity, advanced levels of automation, \neasy-to-use drafting tools and the world's only intelligent link between CAD and pipe stress \nanalysis. It increases accuracy and improves the quality of deliverables for both designers and \nengineers. Compared to every other 3D plant design tool on the market, CADWorx lets you \nget more done in less time - period. \n             \n \n \n  \n1.1 AUTOCAD & CADWORX COMMANDS YOU SHOULD KNOW \n \n \nIn the commands list of AutoCAD, I have tried to include some of the most \nuseful commands which every AutoCAD user must know which is also suitable for \nCADWorx. Some of the commands in this list are very basic commands which are used very \nfrequently and also there are commands which are not often used despite their great features. \n \n1.2 PAGE SETUP \n \n1.
