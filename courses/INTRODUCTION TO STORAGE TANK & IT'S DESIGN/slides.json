Large \ntanks tend to be vertical cylindrical, to easier withstand hydraulic & hydrostatically \ninduced pressure of contained liquid. Most container tanks for handling liquids during \ntransportation are designed to handle varying degrees of pressure. \n2.  FLUIDS STORED IN STEEL TANKS \n \nTanks can be full or empty at the moment of failure during events of natural \nhazards. The content of these tanks is very important because it can avoid extreme failure \nof the shell depending on the quantity and on the physical properties of the liquid. \n \nDensity and specific gravity: \nThe density of the liquid is its mass per unit volume. Water has a density of 1 \ngm/cm3 at 4\u00b0C. The density of a liquid plays an important role in the design of a tank, \nbecause larger densities require thicker shells. \nSpecific gravity is another important physical property of the liquid stored. It is a \nmeasure of the relative weight of one liquid compared to water. Specifically it is the ratio \nof the density of the liquid divided by the density of the water at 15.5\u00b0C. For example, \npetroleum oil, kerosene and gasoline have a specific gravity of 0.82, 0.80 and 0.70 \nrespectively. \nCare must be exercised if there is a significant increase in the specific gravity of \nthe new liquid because the effective hydrostatic pressure acting on the tank walls will be \ngreater if the design level is not reduced, and could cause damage on the cylindrical shell. \n \nVapor pressure and boiling point: \n \nThe vapor pressure of a pure liquid is the pressure of the vapor space above the \nLiquid in a closed container, and increases with increasing temperature. It is an important \nconsideration in order to select the type of tank and its roof and is crucial for the purpose \nof characterizing fire hazardousness.",

            "text": "3 | P a g e  \n \n \nThe boiling point is also important. It is necessary to know the temperatures at \nwhich some liquids should be stored, always below its boiling point.  \n \nPressure: \nPressure is defined as force per unit area. In the United States, the engineers \nworking in this field commonly use inches of water column or ounces per square inches \nto express the value of pressure or vacuum in the vapor space of a tank, because the \npressures are usually very low relative to atmospheric pressure. \nAccording to this pressure the designer should determine the strength and thus \nthickness of the tank. For both cylindrical and spherical shells, the most complex part of \nthe tank to design is the junction between the roof and the cylinder because several \nconditions may occur:  \n(a) When the pressures dominate on the cylinder, the roof deflects to accompany \nthe lower shell; \n  (b) When there is an internal pressure that exceeds the weight of the plates and \nframing of the roof, this junction tends to separate from the shell. \nThis area is the first to show damage. Both external pressures due to wind loads, \nand internal negative pressure can cause similar damage to the structure. \nThe difference of pressure between the inside of the tank, its vapor space, and the \nlocal barometric pressure (atmospheric pressure) is called the internal pressure. \nWhen this pressure is negative, it is called a vacuum.To measure this pressure, it \nis necessary to read it at the top of the liquid in the tank, because the liquid itself exerts \nhydrostatic pressure, which increases to a maximum value at the base of the tank. \nIf a tank has an internal pressure exceeding the value of 100 kN/m2 relative to \natmospheric pressure, they are classified as pressure vessels and are covered by the \ncode for Boiler and pressure Vessels\u201d of ASME (American Society of Mechanical \nEngineers). Such cases are beyond the scope of this work. \nAn external pressure implies that the pressure on the outside of the tank or vessel \nis larger than that on its interior, such the wind pressure due to a hurricane. For an \natmospheric tank, the development of a vacuum in the interior also results in external \npressure. External pressures can be extremely damaging to tanks because their surface \nareas are large and this generates very high forces. The excessive external pressure \nresults in buckling of the shell walls or total collapse.",

The most fundamental \nclassification is based upon whether they are above or belowground. \n \n\uf0b7 Underground storage tanks \n\uf0b7 Aboveground storage tanks \n \n3.1.1 Underground storage tanks \n \nAn underground storage tank system (UST) is a tank and any underground piping \nconnected to the tank that has at least 10 percent of its combined volume underground. \nThe federal UST regulations apply only to UST systems storing either petroleum or certain \nhazardous substances. \nUnderground tanks have less capacity than aboveground tanks and are usually \nlimited to between 20,000 and 75,000 liters (5,000 and 20,000 gal) with most being less \nthan 45,000 liters (12,000 gal). They require special considerations for the earth loads to \nwhich they are subjected, because of their contents. Underground tanks store fuels as \nwell as a variety of chemicals. Another aspect to consider is buoyancy, because they are \nanchored into the ground, they should not be able to pop out during periods when ground \nwater surrounds the tank. In addition, because they are underground, they may be \nsubjected to severe corrosion.",

This pressure effect depends \ndirectly of the size of the tank. The larger the tank, the more severe effect of pressure is \non the structure.

Although they are called atmospheric, they are \nusually operated at internal pressure slightly above atmospheric pressure. The fire codes \ndefine an atmospheric tank as operating from atmospheric up to 3.5 kN/m2 above \natmospheric pressure. \n \n3.2.2 Low-pressure tanks \n \nWithin the context of tanks, low pressure means that tanks are designed for a \npressure higher than atmospheric tanks. This also means that these tanks are relatively \nhigh-pressure tanks. Tanks of this type are designed to operate from atmospheric \npressure up to about 100 kN/m2. \n \n3.2.3 Pressure vessels (high-pressure tanks) \n \nSince high-pressure tanks are really pressure vessels, the term high-pressure tank \nis not frequently used; instead they are called only vessels. Because these kinds of tanks \nare usually built underground, they are not included in this work and they are not covered \nin detail in this discussion. \nHowever, they are treated separately from other tanks by all codes, standards, and \nregulations.",

But this criterion is easier than any other one because tanks are \nclassified only by visual observation. The shape is usually determined by the contents. \nThe vapor pressure of the substance stored or internal design pressure is the broadest \nand most widely used method adopted by codes, standards and regulations, as explained \nabove. For this reason, the vapor pressure determines the shape and, consequently, the \ntype of tank used.  \n\uf0b7 classification based on roof \n\uf0b7 classification based on shell type \n\uf0b7 classification based on bottom \n3.3.1 Classification based on roof \nThe shape of the roof is useful indicator of the type of a tank because it is \nselfexplanatory to tank designer, fabricator and erector. \nFixed-roof tanks: \nMost aboveground tanks have cylindrical shapes on the part that contains \nfluids.The cylinder is an economical, easily fabricated shape for pressure containment. \nAn important feature of such cylindrical tanks is that the top end must be closed. As \ndiscussed before, the relatively flat roof and bottom or closures of tanks do not lend \nthemselves to much internal pressures. As internal pressure increases, the tank \ndesigners use domes or spherical caps. \nFrangible roof: \nRoof plates shall be attached to the top angle of the tank with a continuous fillet \nweld on the top side only.

But for the designer this aspect is very important \nbecause of the varying conditions to which a tank bottom may be subjected. A tank bottom \nmay be broadly classified as flat bottom or conical. \n \n \n \n \n(i)Flat bottom: \nThey are the most common end closures of tanks. These tanks appear flat but \nusually have a small designed slope and shape. These tanks are subclassified according \nto the following categories: \nFlat:  \nFor tanks less than about 6-9 m in diameter, the flat-bottom tank is used. The \ninclusion of a small slope as describe above does not provide any substantial benefit, so \nthey are fabricated as close to flat as possible. \nCone up: \nThese bottoms are built with a high point in the center of the tank. Crowning the \nfoundation and constructing the tank on the crown accomplish this. The slope is limited \nto about 25 to 50 mm per 3 m run. \nCone down: \nThe cone-down design slopes toward the center of the tank. Usually, there is a \ncollection sump at the center. It is very effective for water removal from tanks. This design \nis inherently more complex because it requires a sump, underground piping, and an \nexternal sump outside the tank. \nSingle slope: \nThis design uses a planar bottom but it is tilted slightly to one side. This allows for \ndrainage to be directed to the low point on the perimeter, where it may be effectively \ncollected. Since there is a constant rise across the diameter of the tank, the difference in \nelevation from one side to the other can be quite large. Therefore, this design is usually \nlimited to about 30 m. \n \n(ii)Conical bottom: \nThe second type is the conical bottom. The designers often use it to provide a \ncomplete drainage or even removal of solids. Since these types of tanks are more costly, \nthey are limited to the smaller sizes and are often found in the chemical industry or in \nprocessing plants.",

A geotechnical study of the site is required in the design \nof the foundation; however, in many cases (especially for tanks located in coastal areas) \nthe soils are susceptible to have uniform or differential settlements. The buckling of the \nshell due to the foundation settlement is considered in detail in one of the chaptersof this \nreport. \n \nWhile it is difficult to classify all possible foundation types for storage tanks, some \ngeneral types have proved to be most common for specific applications. Foundation types \nmay be broken into several classifications in generally increasing order of costs: \n \nCompact soil foundations: \n \nThese foundations can be used where the soil quality and bearing capacity are \ngood. Generally, the top 7 to 15 cm of soil is removed and replaced with a sand or granular \nbackfill. These are often called sand pad foundations, laid directly on earth. The \nadvantage of this type of foundation is the relatively low cost. \n \nCrushed-stone ringwall foundations: \n \nThis design happens to incorporate a leak detection system. While it costs less \nthan the concrete ringwall, it has many of the advantage of the concrete ringwall. It \nprovides uniform support of the tank bottom by dissipating concentrated loads in a \ngranular pattern. Catastrophic failure of the bottom is possible if a leak starts and washes \nout the underlying support. \n \nConcrete ringwall foundations: \n \nThe concrete ringwall foundation is so called because of its appearance. It is used \nin foundations for tanks of a diameter of at least 10 m or more. Some of the tanks with \nroof studied in this report are made. In the large-diameter tanks this is usually the most \ncost-effective reinforced concrete foundation, with many advantages such as reducing \nthe probabilities of settlements failures. Slab foundations: The concrete slab foundation \nhas the advantages of the concrete ringwall but is usually limited to tanks with diameters \nless than 10 m.Often the edge of the slab will be sufficiently thick to provide for anchorage. \nA slab foundation is very versatile, but its high cost limits it to use in small tanks. The slab \nprovides a level and plane-working surface that facilitates rapid field erection.",

MATERIALS \nTanks are constructed from a number of different materials based upon the \navailability and cost of the material, ease of fabrication, resistance to corrosion, \ncompatibility with the fluid stored. Sometimes specialized composites and techniques are \nused in tank construction, but these are the exception. \n \n \n \n \nCarbon steel: \n \nCarbon steel, or mild steel, is by far the most common material for tank \nconstruction.This material is readily available, and because of the ease with which it is \nfabricated, machined, formed, and welded, it results in low overall costs. The material \nproperties most commonly assumed for modeling are a modulus of elasticity of 2.068 x \n1011 N/m2, Poisson\u2019s ratio of 0.3, mass density of 7849.7 kg/m3, and yield strength of \n2.156 x 108 N/m2. \n \nStainless steel: \n \nStainless steel, usually the austenitic group of stainless steels, is an important \nmaterial used for storage of corrosive liquids. Although the material cost is significantly \nmore than that of steel, it has the same ease of availability as carbon steel. \n \nFiberglass reinforced polymers: \n \nFiberglass reinforced polymers (FRP) tanks are noted for their resistance to \nchemicals where stainless steel or aluminum tanks are not acceptable. However, the \nfabrication and construction techniques are somewhat more specialized than those for \nmetals fabrication. \n \nAluminum: \n \nAluminum tanks are suitable for a limited number of materials. It is the less \ncommon metal used to build tanks. These tanks remain ductile at temperatures much \nlower than those of carbon steel. However, nickel steels and stainless steels have largely \nsupplanted the market for aluminum tanks. \n \nThe principles of material selection are subdivided in the following engineering \nconsiderations, such as experience, code requirements, brittle fracture and corrosion.  \nLocal engineers experience is very important at the time of choosing the material \nto design the tank. Probably it is the most common way of selecting steel that is \nappropriate for the tank and its service conditions is to rely on past experience with similar \nconditions.",

            "text": "25 | P a g e  \n \n \n \n \nCode requirements that govern tank designs often have very specific material \nselection requirements and limitations. Most modern codes include provisions in the \nmaterial selection criteria that ensure materials with sufficient toughness under the \nservice conditions to prevent brittle fracture. \n \n \n\uf0b7 The susceptibility of the material to brittle fracture is also one of the most important \nmaterial selection considerations. Brittle fracture is the tensile failure of a material \nshowing little deformation or yielding. Brittle fractures typically start at a flaw and \ncan propagate at high speeds, resulting in catastrophic failures. \n \n\uf0b7  Corrosive effects in tanks may be divided into internal and external ones. The \nmost common is the external corrosion that is usually minimized by the used of \ncoatings for carbon steel tanks. \n \n \n\uf0b7 The selection of a design metal temperature is important in ensuring that materials \nare selected which are tough enough to prevent brittle fractures under the service \nconditions. \n \n\uf0b7 Ensuring a material with adequate toughness. One way to ensure that a selected \nsteel has adequate toughness for the design metal temperature of the tank is to \nproof-test each plate by impact toughness testing samples at or below the design \nmetal temperature (DMT). \n \n6. CODES AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS \n \nIndustry standards and codes have been developed primarily on a voluntary basis \nby national standards-setting bodies by industries affected by them. Because the \nstandardssetting bodies in most cases represent the interests of all parties, they must be \nconsensus standards. The purpose of this standards and codes has been to provide \nacceptable, practical, and useful standards that ensure quality, safety, and reliability in \nequipment, practices, operations, or designs.  \n \nMost of the organizations produce different levels of standards, which can be \ngeneralized into the following basic categories:",

For these higher temperature designs, the allowable stress of the material \ndecreases. As a result, the required wall thickness increases in a linear fashion when \nusing the 1-foot method and in a slightly non-linear fashion when using the variable point \nmethod. \n \nIn addition to causing hoop stress and longitudinal stress in the tank wall, the slight \ninternal pressure causes a tensile force (pressure \u00d7 area) to be produced. This force pulls \nupward on the tank wall. This positive upward force is countered by the weight of the tank \nand roof (if not column-supported). If the net force is upward in any case or condition, the \ntank must be held down by anchor bolts.  \n \nThe basic internal pressure case is just one example.

In the normal operation of a low \npressure API 620 tank, it is easily conceivable that the stress in the hoop direction is \ntensile while the axial or longitudinal stress is compressive. \n \nAnother scenario might be that the tank is under a slight vacuum. This case would \ngenerate a compressive stress in both the hoop and longitudinal directions. \n \nBecause this represents a potentially more severe condition, the allowable \ncompressive stress must be computed at each point of concern and compared to the \nactual compressive stress. Then the required thickness due to this condition can be \ndetermined. \n \nSo, depending on the mode in which the tank is operating, the wall could be fully \nunder compression in both directions, fully under tension in both directions, or under a \ncombination of tension and compression. \n \nAPI 620 computes and labels these unit forces as T1 and T2. When T1 and T2 are \nboth in tension, the required thickness is fairly straightforward to compute. It is just the \nmaximum of the two values, divided by the material allowable stress, multiplied by the \njoint efficiency. Of course, the corrosion allowance must be added to the final required \nthickness, if there is one. \n \nWhen T1 and T2 are both compressive, the analysis quickly becomes complex. In \nthis case, the tank wall is subject to buckling. The allowable buckling stress must be \ncalculated and is a function of the thickness to radius ratio. \n \nFor API 620 designs, it is often required to determine the maximum allowable \nworking pressure for both the internal and external pressure cases. This involves \niteratively changing the pressure until the given wall thickness is insufficient. Not only do \nthe shell courses and roof all have to be checked, but the roof to shell junction must be \nanalysed as well.
