Individual skids can contain complete process systems \nand multiple process skids can be combined to create larger process systems or \nentire portable plants. The main advantage of a process skid is quality control. \nBecause only one party will be responsible for the construction and build of the \nskid process unit, there is a higher level of responsibility and quality control. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA designer must have a good knowledge in basic piping, structural and \nequipments before going to design a process skid. At the same time, designers \nmust acquire the knowledge of the any one modeling software such as CAD Worx \nand PDMS. This reference manual provides basic knowledge of piping, structural \nand equipments in the following chapters to ease design of process skids.",

This chapter primarily concerned with \nindustrial piping for processing and service systems. Process piping is used to \ntransport fluids between storage tank and processing units. \n2.1 Introduction: \nPiping is an assembly of piping components used to convey, distribute, mix, \nseparate, discharge, meter, control or snub fluid flows. Piping also includes pipe-\nsupporting elements but does not include support structures, such as building \nframes, bents, foundations, or any equipment excluded from Code definitions. \nPiping components are mechanical elements suitable for joining or \nassembly into pressure-tight fluid containing piping systems. Components include \npipe, tubing, fittings, flanges, gaskets, bolting, valves and devices such as expansion \njoints, flexible joints, pressure hoses, traps, strainers, in-line portions of \ninstruments and separators. \n2.2 Piping and Instrumentation Nomenclature, Components: \nGraphic of sample piping system illustrating \n\uf0b7 header \n\uf0b7 branch connection \n\uf0b7 valve \n\uf0b7 flange \n\uf0b7 pipe support \n\uf0b7 reducer & elbow \nFew other piping, equipment and instrument symbols listed below to ease your \nunderstanding of Piping and instrumentation diagram. The flow diagrams \npresented in this chapter are representative of the types used by many \nengineering and design companies. While actual symbols may vary slightly \nfrom company to company, the general appearance of flow diagrams is the \nsame throughout the piping industry.",

All codes have a common \ntheme, they are intended to set forth engineering requirements deemed necessary \nfor safe design and construction of piping installations. \nThe Codes are not intended to apply to the operation, examination, \ninspection, testing, maintenance or repair of piping that has been placed in service. \nThe Codes do not prevent the User from applying the provisions of the Codes for \nthose purposes. \nEngineering requirements of the Codes, while considered necessary and \nadequate for safe design, generally use a simplified approach. A designer capable \nof applying a more rigorous analysis shall have the latitude to do so, but must be \nable to demonstrate the validity of such analysis. \nDesign Conditions: \nDesign conditions refer to the operating and design temperature and \npressure that the piping system will operate at over the course of its design life. \nCode \nDesign Temperature \nDesign Pressure \nB31.1 \nThe piping shall be designed for a \nmetal temperature representing the \nmaximum \nsustained \ncondition \nexpected.

            "text": "17 | P a g e  \n \nPound ratings, when combined with the temperature of the commodity within \nthe pipe, are used to select the appropriate size, rating, and type of flange. This \npressure/temperature relationship will allow any given flange to be used in many \ndifferent applications. For example, a 150# forged steel flange is rated to perform \nat 150# PSIG at 500 \u00b0F. If the temperature were decreased to 100 \u00b0F, this same \nflange could be used for 275# PSIG. However, if the temperature were increased \nto 750 \u00b0F, the flange could only be used for 100# PSIG. As you can see, the \npressure/temperature relationship is important. When temperature decreases, \nthe allowable pressure increases, and vice versa. \n3.0 EQUIPMENTS: \n \nAlthough piping components such as fittings, flanges, and valves are \nimportant and impossible to do without in a process facility, they play a minor role \nin the actual manufacturing of a salable product. Other components of a piping \nfacility actually perform the tasks for which the facility is being built. Collectively, \nthey are known as mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment can be used to \nstart, stop, heat, cool, liquefy, purify, distill, refine, vaporize, transfer, store, mix, or \nseparate the commodity flowing through the piping system. The discussion in this \nchapter will concentrate on the pieces of equipment that are used in a majority of \nall chemical and refining facilities. \n3.1 Type of Equipments: \nHorizontal Vessels/Accumulators \nThe \nhorizontal \nvessel, similar to the one \nshown in Figure, is a \ncylindrical-shaped storage \ntank that is installed in a \nfacility with its long axis \nparallel to the horizon. Also \nknown as an accumulator, \nit is used primarily as a \nreceiving and collecting \ncontainer for liquids and/or gaseous vapors and, therefore, has no internal moving \nparts. Accumulators can be located at grade level or placed high in an equipment \nstructure. Support saddles, which are U-shaped supports, are welded on the \nunderside to secure and stabilize the vessel as it rests on two concrete foundations, \nwhich are located near each end of the vessel. A nozzle on the top of the vessel \nallows liquids to enter and fill the vessel. Another nozzle, coming off the bottom, \nallows the liquids to be drawn out. Smaller nozzles are positioned that are used for \nventing, draining, and instrumentation attachment.",

It is \none of the most visible pieces of equipment, \nand some vertical vessels can exceed 200 ft in \nheight. Configured as a Fractionation column, \nthese vertical vessels have internal plates \ncalled trays that aid in the refining and \ncollection \nof \nthe \nvarious \nmolecular \ncompounds of a feedstock. The process of \nrefining, or breaking a feed-stock down into \nits various molecular compounds, is called \nfractional distillation. Distillation elicits only \na physical change in a commodity, not a \nchemical one. After further refinement and \nprocessing, these com-pounds will become \nsalable commodities such as fuels, plastics, and many other essential products. \n \nExchangers \nAnother common piece of mechanical equipment is the exchanger. The \nexchanger's primary function in a piping facility is to transfer heat from one \ncommodity to another. Whether the objective is to heat a liquid to a desired \ntemperature or cool a product for final storage, the exchanger can accomplish \nboth. The most important feature \nof \nthe \nexchanger \nis \nthat \ncommodities are mot mixed with \nanother agent to heat it up or cool \nit down. A substantial amount of \ntime \nand \nmoney \nhas \nbeen \ninvested to purify the commodity, \nso mixing any-thing with it, just to \nheat it up or cool it down, would \nbe \ncounterproductive. \nExchangers simply transfer heat \nthrough contact with a metal surface of a different temperature. An exchanger \nmost people are familiar with is the common household water heater whereby \ncold-water flows around a heated element to warm the water. Several exchanger \ntypes are available; they include the shell and tube, double pipe, reboiler, and air \nfan.",

Pumps accelerate the speed at \nwhich a commodity travels within a pipe, thereby increasing its rate of flow. \nPumps used in piping facilities typically will be one of the following classifications: \ncentrifugal, reciprocating, or rotary. \nCentrifugal Pumps \nThe centrifugal force created by the high-speed \nimpellers of a centrifugal pump creates a smooth non-\npulsating rate of flow. With a fast spinning impeller \ncreating a low-pressure center point, any commodity \nentering the pump will naturally seek the center of the \nimpeller only to be spun out at a high rate of speed. The \nefficient operation of the centrifugal pump makes it the \nstandard of most piping facilities. \nReciprocating pumps \nThe reciprocating pump creates Pr. \nwith a piston or plunger that alternately \nmove back and forth. With each stroke of \nthe piston, pressure is increased forcing the \ncommodity \nout \nof \nthe \npump. \nThe \nreciprocating pump is installed in piping \nsystem where extremely high pressures are \nrequired.  \nCompressors: \n \nThe compressor is similar to pump, but \nit is designed to move air gases or vapors \nrather than liquids. The compressor is used to \nincrease the rate at which a gaseous \ncommodity flows from one location to \nanother. Gases, unlike liquids, are elastic and \nmust be compressed to increase flow rate. \nLiquids obviously cannot be compressed, \nunless \nyou \nare \nbuilding \na \nhydraulic \napplication.

Therefore, it becomes necessary to reheat certain commodities after \na period of time. Two types of reboilers are available for use: the kettle-type and \nthe thermosyphon. A kettle-type reboiler is similar in design and appearance to \nthe shell and tube exchanger. The commodity to be heated is routed, via pipe, to \nand from the heater and fractionation column.

Pipe guides confine \nmovement along the pipe's lineal axis. Used primarily to \nmaintain proper line spacing in a pipe rack, pipe guides \nprevent lateral or sideways movement.

One is designed to support a single pipe and the \nother is intended to support multiple lines. Used on lines \nup to 24\" in diameter, and having a load capacity of 4,800 \npounds, the single pipe hanger uses a rod and clevis to \nprovide support.

By using \nsimplified drawing symbols, to represent various pieces of mechanical equipment, \nvalving, and instrumentation, and specific notes, callouts, and abbreviations, the \nflow diagram provides the piping designer with an overall view of the operation of \na facility. It guides the designer in the same manner a road map guides a traveler. \nThis drawing provides the following specific design criteria \n The operating and design conditions (pressures and temperatures) \n Pipe line numbers with direction of commodity flow \n Pipe specifications and line sizes \n All mechanical equipment \n All operating and isolating valves \n All controlling instrumentation with transmitting devices \nRefer section 2.2 for more details. \nStep: 2 Collect basic input design data\u2019s \n \nCollect the following input data\u2019s from \u201cstep: 1\u201d to find out the preliminary \ndesign considerations. \n Design Pressure \n \n Design temperature \n Process Fluid and their properties \n Fluid service \n Design code \n Preliminary pipe sizes \n Plot area \n Skid boundary \nRefer section 2.5 for more details.",

Steam lines may be run below grade in trenches provided with \ncovers or (for short runs) in sleeves. \n Lines that are usually buried include drains and lines bringing in water or \ngas.
