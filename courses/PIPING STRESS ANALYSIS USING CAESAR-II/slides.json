Limiting stresses below code \nallowable. \nOperational Integrity: \n\uf0b7 Limiting nozzle loads of the connected equipment within allowable values. \n\uf0b7 Avoiding leakage at joints. \n\uf0b7 Limiting sagging & displacement within allowable values. \n \nOptimal Design: \n\uf0b7 Avoiding excessive flexibility and also high loads on supporting structures. Aim \ntowards an optimal design for both piping and structure. \n \n \nGOVERNING CODES AND STANDARDS \nCodes and Standards specify minimum requirements for safe design and construction \n(i. e. provides material, design, fabrication, installation and inspection requirements.) \nFollowing are the codes and standards used for Refinery Piping: \n1.

(E.g. Pressure, \nWeight). These loads are present continuously throughout plant life. \nResistive force arising out of sustained stresses balance the external forces keeping \nthe system in equilibrium. Exceeding sustain allowable stress value causes catastrophic \nfailure of the system. \nAs per ASME B 31.3, (clause 302.3.5) \u201c The sum of the longitudinal stresses, SL, in \nany component in a piping system, due to sustained loads such as pressure and weight, shall \nnot exceed the product Sh x W \u201d. Where, Sh=Basic allowable stress at maximum metal \ntemperature expected during the displacement cycle and W=weld joint strength reduction \nfactor. \nPressure Stresses are taken care of by calculating and selecting proper pipe \nthickness. The pressure thickness (t) of a straight pipe can be obtained as per ASME B31.3 \nfrom the equation (Clause 304.1.2) mentioned in Fig.1a:",
