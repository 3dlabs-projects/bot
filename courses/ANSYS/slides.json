It is used to test its strength and test of what would it behave in \nits environment. All types of analysis test Such as thermal, fatigue, structural, CFD etc\u2026 can \nbe conducted. It is basically a simulation software to visualize working model without actually \nmaking it in the real world. \n2. WHY SHOULD WE DO ANALYSIS \n  \nLet\u2019s consider you are manufacturing a product. In the first place you need to \nmanufacture some prototypes of the product and test it for all kinds of worse situation that could \nhappen to damage the product. In some cases, you need to conduct few tests to optimize the \nmaterial required, the design, the loads if any acting on the product, the natural frequency or its \ntemperature controlling mechanism, and many more. In order to know the every detail of your \nproduct you need to manufacture prototypes. This would eventually lead to increase the cost to \ncompany.       \n  \nIn that case, we use the analysis software\u2019s like ANSYS. ANSYS uses the certain inputs \nand evaluates the product behaviour in their environment. This would certainly reduce the cost \nof producing prototypes and mainly the time. In this competitive world the accuracy and time \nare the most deciding factors for the company or the organization to sustain. ANSYS helps in \nincreasing the accuracy and decreasing the time of outcome of the final product. ANSYS can \nimport all kinds of CAD geometries (3D and 2D) from different CAD software's and perform \nsimulations. ANSYS has inbuilt CAD developing software's like Design Modeler and Space \nClaim which makes the work flow even smoother. \n \n3. ELASTIC STRESS ANALYSIS METHOD \nHere, we going to study about the stress analysis of vessel. Stress                        \nanalysis is the determination of the relationship between external forces applied to a vessel and \nthe corresponding stresses. The starting place for stress analysis is to determine all the design \ncondition for a given problem and then determine all the related external forces. We must then \nrelate these external forces to the vessel parts which must resist them to find the corresponding \nstresses.",

To \nevaluate protection against plastic collapse, the results from an elastic stress analysis of the \ncomponent subject to defined loading conditions are compared to an associated limiting value.  \n \n \n \n(1) A quantity known as the equivalent stress is computed at locations in the component \nand compared to an allowable value of equivalent stress to determine if the component is suitable \nfor the intended design conditions. The equivalent stress at a point in a component is a measure \nof stress, calculated from stress components utilizing a yield criterion, which is used for \ncomparison with the mechanical strength properties of the material obtained in tests under \nuniaxial load. \n(2) The maximum distortion energy yield criterion shall be used to establish the \nequivalent stress.
