As the fluid \ntemperature, pressure & velocity are very low, small size pipes like 1/2\", 3/4\" diameter are moslty used \nfor carrying water and gas in household usage. These pipes are connected by screwed fittings.. \nRefineries, power plant etc. uses large size pipes like 24\u201d, 42\u201d diameter. Here, the pipes are \njoined using welded connections. In these pipes, fluid pressure and temperature are very high so we \ncannot use screwed fittings.  \nAs mentioned above, pipe sizes are determined by the fluid pressure, temperature and its \nvelocity. Pipe thickness are mainly concerned with fluid pressure. Because pipes may explode if the \nfluid pressure exceeds its allowable limit. In order to prevent such accidents, large thickness pipes are \nused. \nGenerally, Standards are followed in manufacturing processes to determine the sizes and \nmaterials of the pipes. Standard pipes are manufactured using dies. If the required pipe size is larger \nthan the available standard size, plates with required thickness are rolled to make those pipes.  \n \n Types of Fittings \nSome of the pipe fittings are shown below",
