The pressure is the design internal pressure plus the additional static \nliquid pressure at the nozzle location. This option is appropriate for re-rating \nvessels or for the design of new vessels where there are no MAWP \nconsiderations. If the overall MAWP of the vessel is to be determined, it is \nstrongly recommended that the model be rerun with the computed MAWP to be \nsure that all components pass at this higher pressure, which will be stamped \non the nameplate. The pressure for all elements can be changed at Design \nInternal Press on the Design Constraints Tab.  \n\uf0b7 Overall MAWP + Static Head (governing element) - Calculates one design \ninternal pressure for all of the nozzles located on the vessel, based on the static \nliquid pressure to the bottom of the element that is governing the MAWP. If the \nnozzle location on a vessel changes due to a client request, there is no need to \nrerun nozzle calculations because the pressure used in the calculations does \nnot change. This method is ideal for designing new vessels and is the most \nconservative option.  \n\uf0b7 MAWP + Static Head to Nozzle - Calculates the MAWP of the vessel and then \nadds the static liquid pressure from the liquid surface to the nozzle location. For \nnozzles at different elevations, the design pressure will vary.  \n \nNote: \n \nIf the resulting nozzle reinforcement MAWP does not need to govern the MAWP \nof the vessel, options 1, 3 or 4 should be used. This is a common requirement for \nvessels that are used in the chemical and petro-chemical industries. \n \nConsider MAPnc: \n \nSelect to require that nozzle reinforcement calculations are performed for the \nMAP new and cold condition.

For example, the OD of a cylinder would be reduced by two \ntimes the external corrosion allowance for the external pressure calculation.

This option \nis only available when Flaw Type is set to Part 4 (General Metal Loss). \nIf you select this option, you are confirming the assumption of uniform metal \nloss. Point thickness readings may be used to characterize the metal loss in a \ncomponent if there are no significant differences in the thickness reading values \nobtained at inspection monitoring locations. \nA minimum of 15 thickness readings should be used unless the level of NDE \nused can confirm that the metal loss is general. In some cases, additional readings \nmight be required based on the size of the component, the construction details used, \nand the nature of the environment resulting in the metal loss. A sample data sheet to \nrecord thickness readings is shown in Table 4.2. \nIf the Coefficient of Variation (COV) of the thickness readings is greater than \n10%, then thickness profiles shall be considered for use in the assessment (see \nparagraph 4.3.3.3). The COV is defined as the standard deviation divided by the \naverage. \n \nCritical Thickness Profile \nSelect this option to use thickness profiles to characterize the metal loss in a \ncomponent. You must use this option if there is a significant variation in the thickness \nreadings, which can indicate the metal loss might be localized. Thickness profiles \nshould be used to character the remaining thickness and size of the region of metal \nloss. \n \nPitting Data (Part 6 Only) \nSelect this option to consider pitting data. This option is only available when \nFlaw Type is set to Part 6 (Pitting). \n \n\uf0d8 Level 1 Assessment - The surface damage is measured in terms of \npitted area, and the maximum pit depth is used to quantify the extent of \npitting damage. You can use the standard pit charts (see Figures 6.3 to \n6.10) to compare the actual damage on the component to the damage \nrepresented on the pit chart. The pit chart and an estimate of the \nmaximum pit depth are used to determine acceptability. A cross \nsectional UT thickness scan can determine the pitting profile. Guidelines \nfor determining the maximum pit depth are in paragraph 6.3.4.1 of the \ncode.  \n\uf0d8 Level 2 Assessment - The surface damage is measured using a pit-\ncouple (two pits separated by a solid ligament, see Figure 6.11). The \nmetal loss of each pit in a pit-couple is modeled as an equivalent \ncylinder. The diameter and depth of each pit, and the distance between \nthe pit centers are also required. The orientation of the pit-couple in the \nbiaxial stress field can also be included in the assessment (see Figure \n6.11). The depth and diameter of a pit should be carefully measured \nbecause of the variety of pit types that can occur in service (see Figure \n6.12). If the pit has an irregular shape, a diameter and depth that \nencompasses the entire shape should be used in the assessment.",
